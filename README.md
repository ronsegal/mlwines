Machine Learning Wines Application

Note that the application was generated from the mlwines.Rmd file (which was uploaded to shinyapps.io) so that it is a self documenting application, ui and server functions are included within the single shinyapp application.

The ui.R and server.R files in the repository are included only to satisfy the Coursera assignment 
instructions that appear to assume these two files! The ui.R/server.R pair can be run to achieve a similar result as mlwines.Rmd, obviously without generating the documentation.

Best wishes
